Project Name: Westwood High School Course Advisor
Description: Our AI-powered tool, the Westwood High School Course Advisor, revolutionizes the way students plan their high school journey. It offers a multitude of features designed to simplify the course selection process. My website offers a variety of things for the school, such as a simplified course catalog with filter options that uses webscraping techniques to actively acquire data from the school's choice sheet, a four-year-plan builder for students to plan all their courses for the following years of high school, and even an AI chatbot just for Westwood High School! The chatbot is trained so that it only answers questions related to courses, so ask a relevant question! :)
